+ Changes (Alliance-)Missions,
  - Fixed, sorting of the missions (Old => New, NOT New => Old) @thx Viper
  - Fixed, Alliance missions are fully processed if standard vehicle(s) are declared and the conditions are NOT met
  - Optimization, availability is checked BEFORE the task and no longer IN the task (lowers CPU load, faster processing)

+ Mandatory, 
  - Error and source code optimization
  - Source code viewed, lines of code counted
